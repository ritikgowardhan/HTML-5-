                Chandragupta Maurya with the guidance of Acharya Chanakya <Q>succeeded</Q> in overthrowing the Nanda Empire 
                and established the <ins>first great empire</ins> in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. Most of the Indian 
                subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. From the 3rd 
                century BCE onwards, Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and Tamil Sangam literature in southern 
                India started to flourish.[6][7] Wootz steel originated in  <b>south</b> in the 3rd century BCE and was 
                exported.[8][9][10] <i>The Maurya <cite>would</cite>  collapse</i> in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-Emperor 
                Brihadratha by his <strong>General Pushyamitra Shunga.</strong> Shunga would go on to form the Shunga Empire in the North 
                and Northeast of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the Northwest and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. 
                <mark>parts of India</mark>Various  were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire in the 
                4-6th centuries CE.

                        This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and 
                        intellectual resurgence, is known as the Classical or
                         Golden Age of India. During this time, aspects of Indian
                          civilisation, administration, culture, and religion 
                          spread to much of Asia. Kingdoms in southern India had
                           maritime business links with the Middle East and the
                           Mediterranean. Indian cultural influence spread over
                            many parts of Southeast Asia, which led to the 
                            establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region,
                             forming the Greater India.[11][12]

                       The most significant event between the 7th and 11th
                        century was the Tripartite struggle centred on
                         Kannauj that lasted for <abber title="world health organisation">WHO</abber> more than two centuries
                          between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire,
                           and Gurjara-Pratihara Empire. Southern India
                            saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from 
                            the middle of the fifth century, most notably
                             the Chalukya, Chola, Pallava, Chera, Pandyan, and Western Chalukya Empires. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India and successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bengal
